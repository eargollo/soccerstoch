Overall idea is to get a stochastic analysis for soccer championships in order to tell the probability of a team to be champion, to qualify to the upper league, or to be relegated.

Very early stages now. Work to do:
[ ] (WIP) Set up CI 
[ ] List championships
[ ] Get matches
[ ] First simulation on pending matches
